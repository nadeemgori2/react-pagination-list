# Implement a lazy-loaded user list with a custom-loading component

What the test app should do:

- Display a custom loading component for 3 seconds
- Fetch user data from https://reqres.in/
- Display those users in a scrollable view that lazy loads more users when you've reached the bottom of the list, if there are no more users to load it should indicate that there are no more users.
- Be responsive, look great, and work well on different devices, especially various mobile screens

We've prepared some screenshots in the design folder and a video of what the loading component should look like.

Those are the requirements. Feel free to expand upon the app if you wish to show off more of your skillset. We encourage you to solve the challenge using your favorite libraries and take the opportunity to present your toolbox, preferences, and experience.

We only ask that you be able to motivate your choices.

Before submitting your result please make sure that:

- The code is formatted (including your favorite linter is a good idea); code that does not meet basic readability criteria will be rejected
- The application resembles what is visible on screenshots in the design folder
- The application meets the criteria listed above in common desktop and mobile browsers
